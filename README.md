## About the plugins

Obsidian by default does not support the viewing and editing of various code files, and Obsidian VSCode Editor was created to solve this problem. 

It is based on [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) (VSCode Editor kernel) development, support for viewing and editing of various code format files, including but not limited to: ` C `, `C++`, `C#` , ` CSS `, ` Go `, ` HTML`, `Java`, `JavaScript`, `JSON`, `Python`, `Ruby`, `Rust`, `Shell`, `XML`, `YAML`, `ini`, etc.

You no longer have to open another editor just to view or edit a certain code file, everything is done in Obsidian.



## Basic features

- Support for viewing and editing files in various code formats, just like you edit code locally with VSCode
- Supports setting the editor's theme colors, including light themes and dark themes
- Support to set the font size of the editor, and provide a shortcut to adjust the font size by `ctrl+ mouse wheel`
- You can set whether to display the line number
- Supports setting whether to display indent guides
- Supports setting whether to display code thumbnails
- Shortcut icon buttons or commands to create new code files
